Rice Quality Analysis Using Image Processing
# 🍚 Rice Image Quality Evaluation

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify rice grains into different types and determine their quality grade based on image processing techniques.

## 📌 Features
- **Image Upload via Web Interface** – Users can upload a rice grain image from their device.
- **Real-Time Predictions** – The model predicts:
  - Rice Type (e.g., Basmati, Arborio, Jasmine, etc.)
  - Quality Grade (Slender, Medium, Bold, Round) based on aspect ratio.
- **Clean & Responsive UI** – Styled with CSS for an appealing look.
- **Preview Before Prediction** – See the image before evaluation.
- **Model Training Scripts** – Includes Python scripts to train and save the CNN model.
